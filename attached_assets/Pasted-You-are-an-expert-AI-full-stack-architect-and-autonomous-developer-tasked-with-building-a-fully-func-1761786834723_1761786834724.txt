You are an expert AI full-stack architect and autonomous developer tasked with building a fully functional AI-powered sales automation platform called OmniReach ‚Äî a customizable, workflow-driven, multi-channel sales engagement system.
The application must be:
Open-source friendly, low-cost (use open-source tools wherever possible)
Cloud-agnostic, deployable via Docker and compatible with local or cloud environments
Visually stunning, with an intuitive UI/UX suitable for non-technical business users
Extensible, supporting plugins, custom workflows, and integrations
Secure, compliant with GDPR, CAN-SPAM, and other data laws
AI-integrated, using OpenRouter or Mistral API for all LLM tasks (generation, analysis, and personalization)
You will build the application progressively, following the phased roadmap below, ensuring each phase is functional and tested before moving to the next.
‚öôÔ∏è DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript + React Flow + Zustand
Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Node.js (Express) ‚Äî developer‚Äôs choice
Database: PostgreSQL (primary) + Redis (cache)
Message Queue / Worker: Celery or BullMQ
Vector Store: Chroma or PGVector
Authentication: JWT-based with optional Keycloak integration
Deployment: Docker Compose for dev, Kubernetes-ready for prod
LLM Integration: OpenRouter or Mistral API
Logging/Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki (optional)
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
üåê HIGH-LEVEL GOAL
Build a self-learning, customizable sales engagement platform that automates outreach, follow-ups, and relationship management through AI-generated, multi-channel, personalized workflows.
The system should:
Automate the full sales cycle (lead ‚Üí outreach ‚Üí follow-up ‚Üí meeting ‚Üí negotiation ‚Üí deal).
Support custom workflows with drag-and-drop builders.
Include AI personas, relationship intelligence, RAG-enhanced communication, and multi-channel outreach.
Feature a marketplace for workflow templates, personas, and plugins.
Provide a beautiful, intuitive UI that makes complex automation feel simple.
üß© BUILD PLAN: PHASE-BY-PHASE EXECUTION
Phase 0 ‚Äî Foundations (Setup & Baseline)
Goal: Set up the full stack, boilerplate, and CI/CD.
Tasks:
Initialize monorepo (frontend + backend + infra).
Add Docker, docker-compose, .env, and seed data.
Setup linting, formatting, and test frameworks.
Implement base auth (JWT), roles (Admin, Sales, Viewer).
Add simple health check and logging.
Deliverable:
A running local app (docker-compose up) with a login screen, dashboard shell, and seed data.
Phase 1 ‚Äî Core MVP Workflow (Email Pipeline)
Goal: Build a minimal working sales workflow that sends AI-personalized emails.
Features:
Lead CRUD, CSV import/export
Persona creation (name, tone, industry focus)
Workflow builder (React Flow)
AI integration: generate message based on persona + lead context
Email sender (SMTP or SendGrid) + webhook tracking (opens/replies)
Basic analytics dashboard
Deliverable:
End-to-end demo: create lead ‚Üí run workflow ‚Üí send email ‚Üí track open/reply.
Phase 2 ‚Äî Durable Workflow Engine & Async Execution
Goal: Turn workflows into durable, stateful executions.
Features:
WorkflowRun + NodeRun models with retry logic
Celery or BullMQ worker for async task execution
Node types: AI Generate, Send Email, Wait, Decision
Workflow logs, retries, pause/resume
Deliverable:
Workflow can pause, resume, and recover after server restart.
Phase 3 ‚Äî Multi-channel Adapters (LinkedIn, SMS, Calendar)
Goal: Add multiple outreach channels with fallback logic.
Features:
Adapters for Email, SMS (Twilio), LinkedIn (API/automation-safe), and Calendly
Unified send_message() interface
Channel fallback and webhook updates
Channel-specific analytics
Deliverable:
Workflow can automatically use next available channel (e.g., no reply via email ‚Üí LinkedIn DM).
Phase 4 ‚Äî Relationship Graph & RAG Intelligence
Goal: Add contextual intelligence and memory.
Features:
Relationship graph (Postgres graph or Neo4j)
Sentiment tracking on replies
Vector store (Chroma/PGVector) for past messages + documents
RAG-enhanced AI messages (retrieve context before generation)
Deliverable:
Messages reference past interactions and relationship score updates dynamically.
Phase 5 ‚Äî Persona Studio & Policy Engine
Goal: Deep customization of tone, compliance, and style.
Features:
Persona Studio UI: tone sliders, upload samples
Policy engine: define constraints (no discount > X%, no SMS without consent)
Pre-send simulation sandbox
Deliverable:
Messages reflect persona voice and adhere to company policies.
Phase 6 ‚Äî Autonomous Negotiation Agent
Goal: Safe AI-driven negotiation.
Features:
Rule-based negotiation agent (min/max price, allowed clauses)
Transaction templates (contracts, offers)
Explainability UI (why agent made each decision)
Deliverable:
Agent can autonomously propose deals within defined limits.
Phase 7 ‚Äî Marketplace & Plugin Ecosystem
Goal: Enable extensibility and community-driven growth.
Features:
Workflow/Persona ‚Äúblock‚Äù packaging system (JSON + metadata)
Marketplace UI to browse, install, and rate blocks
SDK + CLI for developers to publish new blocks
Deliverable:
Users can import/export workflows and share persona templates.
Phase 8 ‚Äî Enterprise & Security Enhancements
Goal: Prepare for enterprise customers.
